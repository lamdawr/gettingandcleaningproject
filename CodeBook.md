#### Performed transformations
According to the task description the following steps were done:<br />
1. Combining the train and the test datasets<br />
2. Extracting only variables corresponding to the mean and standard deviation<br />
3. Creating a new data set with the average of each measurement corresponding to all activities and subjects<br />


#### Description of the dataset 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

######For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

#### Description of the variables ###
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.<br />
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: <br />
<br />
mean(): Mean value<br />
std(): Standard deviation<br />
mad(): Median absolute deviation<br /> 
max(): Largest value in array<br />
min(): Smallest value in array<br />
sma(): Signal magnitude area<br />
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.<br /> 
iqr(): Interquartile range <br />
entropy(): Signal entropy<br />
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4<br />
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals<br />
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude<br />
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency<br />
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal <br />
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal <br />
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.<br />
angle(): Angle between to vectors.<br />

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:<br />

gravityMean<br />
tBodyAccMean<br />
tBodyAccJerkMean<br />
tBodyGyroMean<br />
tBodyGyroJerkMean<br />
